# 🎬 Tell Me Your Story - Local File Version

## ✅ What Changed

The Gradio interface has been updated to work with **local files only** - no API keys required!

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Run the demo** (optional, to test everything works):
   ```bash
   python demo_local_files.py
   ```

2. **Start the Gradio interface**:
   ```bash
   python run_gradio.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:7860`

## 📁 Required Files (Already Present)

The interface needs these files, which you already have:

### Screenplays (in `outputs/`):
- ✅ `screenplay.txt`
- ✅ `screenplay1.txt` through `screenplay5.txt`

### Images (in `outputs/openAIImages/`):
- ✅ `image0.png` (1.7 MB)
- ✅ `image1.png` (1.7 MB)  
- ✅ `image2.png` (1.7 MB)

### Videos (in `outputs/falVideos/`):
- ✅ `video0.mp4` (1.4 MB)
- ✅ `video1.mp4` (if available)
- ✅ `video2.mp4` (if available)
*Note: All available videos will play sequentially*

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **Frame 1**: Enter a story prompt → Click "📖 Load Screenplay" → Screenplay loads with typewriter effect (8 seconds)
2. **Frame 2**: Watch dramatic typewriter animation → Click "🖼️ Load Images" → Images load progressively
3. **Frame 3**: Watch 3 images load one by one (5 seconds each, 15 seconds total) → Click "🎥 Load Video"
4. **Frame 4**: Watch ALL videos play sequentially - each video loads and plays automatically one after another!

## 🔧 Key Features

- ✅ **No API keys needed**
- ✅ **Cinematic typewriter effects** (8-second screenplay + 5-second per image loading animations)
- ✅ **Progressive loading** for both screenplay and images with real-time progress
- ✅ **Sequential video playback** - all available videos play one by one automatically
- ✅ **Offline operation**
- ✅ **Multi-phase progress tracking** with percentage display for all loading phases
- ✅ **Automatic playlist experience** for video content
- ✅ **Error handling** for missing files
