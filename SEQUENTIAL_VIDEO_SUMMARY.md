# 🎬 Sequential Video Playback Implementation

## 🎯 What Was Added

The Gradio interface now features **sequential video playback** in Frame 4, where all videos in the `AVAILABLE_VIDEOS` list play one by one automatically.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Function: `load_videos_sequentially()`**

```python
def load_videos_sequentially():
    """Load and play all videos from AVAILABLE_VIDEOS list one by one."""
    # Check which video files exist
    existing_videos = [v for v in AVAILABLE_VIDEOS if os.path.exists(v)]
    
    total_videos = len(existing_videos)
    
    # Play videos one by one
    for i, video_path in enumerate(existing_videos):
        video_num = i + 1
        
        # Start loading this video
        yield None, f"🎥 Loading video {video_num}/{total_videos}..."
        time.sleep(1.0)  # Brief loading time
        
        # Display the video
        yield video_path, f"🎬 Playing video {video_num}/{total_videos}: {video_name}"
        
        # Let video play for a duration
        if i < total_videos - 1:  # Not the last video
            time.sleep(3.0)  # 3 seconds viewing time
            yield video_path, f"▶️ Video {video_num}/{total_videos} playing... Next video loading soon..."
            time.sleep(1.0)  # Brief pause before next video
        else:  # Last video
            yield video_path, f"✅ All {total_videos} videos played successfully!"
```

## 📁 Available Videos

The system looks for videos in this order:
1. `./outputs/falVideos/video0.mp4`
2. `./outputs/falVideos/video1.mp4`
3. `./outputs/falVideos/video2.mp4`

Only existing videos will be played in sequence.

## 🎬 User Experience

### **Sequential Playback Flow**
1. User clicks "🎥 Load Video" in Frame 3
2. **Loading Phase**: "🎥 Loading video 1/3..."
3. **Playing Phase**: "🎬 Playing video 1/3: video0.mp4"
4. **Transition Phase**: "▶️ Video 1/3 playing... Next video loading soon..."
5. **Repeat for each video**
6. **Final Phase**: "✅ All 3 videos played successfully!"

### **Timing**
- **Loading time per video**: 1 second
- **Viewing time per video**: 3 seconds (except last video)
- **Transition time**: 1 second between videos
- **Total approximate time**: `(videos × 5 seconds) - 2 seconds`
  - For 3 videos: ~13 seconds total

## 🚀 Usage

The sequential video playback is automatically activated when users click the "🎥 Load Video" button in Frame 3. The system will:

1. Check which videos exist in the `AVAILABLE_VIDEOS` list
2. Play them sequentially with loading animations
3. Provide status updates throughout the process
4. End with the final video remaining displayed

```bash
# Start the interface with sequential video playback
python run_gradio.py

# Test the sequential video functionality
python test_sequential_videos.py
```

## 🎭 Complete Experience

The full user journey now includes:
1. **Screenplay typewriter** (8 seconds)
2. **Progressive image loading** (15 seconds for 3 images)
3. **Sequential video playback** (~13 seconds for 3 videos)

**Total immersive experience**: ~36 seconds of engaging animations!

This creates a complete **cinematic storytelling experience** from text to images to videos! 🎬✨
